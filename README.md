#PRBOOM Map DESIGN - Tutorial

Unpack Eureka to load the tutorial maps, and load the wad's (map) with prboom (argument -file).

Map09 from directory 01 is more fun with freedom2, or much better with aaliens.wad
 -iwad freedoom2  -file aaliens.wad map09-game.wad // based on contribs
 or 
 -iwad freedoom2  map09-game.wad   // fully GNU
